# KickStarter Analysis

This repository explores a limited dataset of Kickstarter campaigns. The objective is to use the raw data in order to provide useful feedback to all stakeholders. The analysis will try to identify any trends and produce any useful visuals that would aid stakeholders in launching successful campaigns.

## Background

Over $2 billion has been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the more than 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.
Getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, so many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick for finding success.
